# 🫁 Lung Cancer Risk Prediction System

A machine learning–powered web application designed to **predict lung cancer risk** based on patient lifestyle habits, symptoms, and health conditions.
This project demonstrates a **complete real-world data science workflow**, from model training to interactive deployment.

## 📌 Overview

Lung cancer is one of the most life-threatening diseases globally, and early risk identification plays a crucial role in improving survival rates.
This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and predict potential lung cancer presence using a robust ensemble model.

The final solution is deployed as an **interactive web application**, allowing users to input health details and instantly receive a prediction.


## 🎯 Objectives

* Build an accurate lung cancer prediction model
* Apply real-world data preprocessing and feature engineering
* Evaluate model performance using standard ML metrics
* Deploy the trained model using an interactive UI
* Create a portfolio-ready, end-to-end ML project


## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

* Supervised classification problem
* Ensemble learning using a Random Forest model
* Categorical feature encoding
* Train–test data splitting for unbiased evaluation
* Model persistence for real-time inference


## 📊 Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated using industry-standard metrics to ensure reliability and performance:

* Accuracy Score
* Confusion Matrix
* Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
* Feature Importance Analysis

These evaluations help understand both **model correctness** and **decision behavior**.


## 🔍 Feature Importance

One of the strengths of this project is interpretability.
The model identifies which health and lifestyle factors contribute most to lung cancer risk, supporting explainable and transparent predictions.


## 🖥️ Interactive Web Application

The project includes a user-friendly web interface where:

* Users select health and lifestyle attributes
* Inputs are processed in real time
* The system predicts lung cancer risk instantly

This bridges the gap between **machine learning models** and **real-world usability**.
